# Weather-Dashboard
 By far the most challanging assignment thus far. I had no problem with fetching and displaying the data.
 * I used the current weather api to fetch and display current forecast, along with pulling the longitude 
 and latitude for the five-day forecast api
 * I used the longitude and latitude to fetch the same location as current forecast through the one call api.
 * As for both forecast, I had hard coded the ul and li. Therefore, All i needed to do way plug in the data
 by jquery selectors.

 The most challanging aspect was localStorage and generating the buttons to coorespond with each other.
 *At first I stored the data in objects and eventually figured out that it was much more difficult to do it that
 way.
 *Once i figured out to use array and figured out how to compare the stored array with the array to store, Everything
 started to come together.
